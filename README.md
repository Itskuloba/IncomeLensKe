IncomeLensKE: Data Analytics Capstone Project Proposal

Project Title
IncomeLensKE: Analyzing Household Expenditure Patterns in Kenya

Project Description
IncomeLensKE investigates how income levels, household demographics, and geographic location shape household expenditure patterns in Kenya using the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) data. The project examines spending on food and non-food items, calculates per capita expenditures, and identifies regional disparities to provide actionable insights for policymakers, NGOs, economists, and researchers. By leveraging interactive visualizations and data-driven analysis, it aims to inform economic planning, poverty reduction strategies, and equitable policy development.

Problem Statement
Inconsistent and poorly understood household expenditure patterns in Kenya, driven by disparities in income levels, household demographics, and regional differences, hinder efficient resource allocation, perpetuate poverty, and limit effective economic planning. This project examines how income, household size, and location influence spending on essential and non-essential items, identifies regional disparities, and delivers data-driven insights through interactive dashboards to support poverty reduction and equitable policy development.

Research Questions

How does total monthly expenditure vary with household size?
What are the significant differences in expenditures between urban and rural residential areas?
What percentage of households fall below the absolute poverty line based on their expenses?
What are the key regional disparities for targeted policy interventions?
What is the breakdown of consumption expenditure by category (e.g., food, housing, education)?
What is the correlation between household size and total consumption expenditure?


Target Audience

Policymakers: For evidence-based economic planning and poverty reduction strategies.
NGOs: To target interventions for vulnerable households.
Economists: To understand expenditure patterns and income distribution.
Researchers: To build on findings for further socioeconomic studies.


Planned Features

Data Collection: Scrape supplementary data (e.g., poverty line thresholds, regional economic indicators) to complement KIHBS data.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Use Excel and Pandas to clean and preprocess KIHBS data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Pandas and NumPy to identify patterns and correlations in expenditure data.
Visualizations: Create static (Matplotlib/Seaborn), interactive (Plotly), and spatial (Geopandas) visualizations, plus Tableau dashboards.
Data Storytelling: Present insights through compelling visuals and a policy-relevant narrative.


Technologies / Concepts
Tools and techniques used for data analysis, querying, and visualization:

-**Tableau** – To create interactive dashboards and visualizations

-**Excel** – For data cleaning, preprocessing, and manual inspection

-**Data Cleaning & Integration** – Handling missing values, removing whitespaces, and merging multiple datasets




Excel: Initial data cleaning, preprocessing, and manual inspection.
Tableau: Create interactive dashboards with KPIs, filters, and maps.
Data Cleaning & Integration: Handle missing values, standardize formats, and merge datasets.


Data Source

Primary Source: KIHBS datasets from Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), covering household income, expenditure, size, and location.
Supplementary Source: Scrape poverty line thresholds, regional GDP, or consumer price indices from KNBS, Central Bank of Kenya, or World Bank websites.
Manual Cleaning: Use Excel to inspect and clean KIHBS data (e.g., remove whitespaces, standardize categories).


Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if it:

Clearly demonstrates how income, household size, and location influence expenditure patterns.
Produces insightful Tableau dashboards with interactive visualizations.
Answers all research questions with data-driven conclusions.
Identifies actionable policy insights for poverty reduction and equitable resource allocation.


Stretch Goals

Use machine learning (e.g., clustering with scikit-learn) to classify households by spending behavior or predict vulnerability to poverty.
Incorporate time-series forecasting to predict future expenditure trends based on income and demographic changes.
