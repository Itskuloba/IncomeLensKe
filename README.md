## Project Title  
_IncomeLensKe_

## Project Description

_This project analyzes how income levels and demographic characteristics influence household expenditure patterns in Kenya using national survey data._
It answers the question, How do income levels and household demographics influence expenditure patterns in Kenya, and what insights can policymakers derive to improve economic planning and poverty reduction?

It will:

- Examine the relationship between household income, size, and location with spending on food and non-food items
- Calculate per capita expenditures and highlight regional disparities
- Visualize insights through Tableau dashboards
- Provide insights that can inform targeted social policies, poverty reduction strategies, and budget planning tools

## Purpose / Problem Solved

This project seeks to uncover how income levels and demographic factors influence how Kenyan households allocate their income across essential and non-essential needs.

By analyzing nationally representative data:

- It highlights patterns in income distribution
- It helps identify how much of a household’s income goes to food, education, housing, and utilities and how this varies by region, household size, or income level
- The findings offer insights that can empower individuals and policymakers with data on Spending habits, tax reliefs, Savings potential, Investment readiness

## Planned Features


[✓] **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Prepare KIHBS data for structured analysis 

[✓] **SQL Database Design** – Normalize and store household income and expenditure data across related tables

[✓] **Tableau Dashboards** – Visualize expenditure trends through Engel curves, income-based spending breakdowns and inequality heat maps

[✓] **Data Storytelling** – Presenting insights through compelling visuals and a policy-relevant narrative

[✓] **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify patterns and correlations between demographic variables and spending


---

## Technologies / Concepts I Plan to Use

Tools and techniques used for data analysis, querying, and visualization:

-**SQL** – To store, query, and analyze large household datasets

-**Tableau** – To create interactive dashboards and visualizations

-**Excel** – For data cleaning, preprocessing, and manual inspection

-**Data Cleaning & Integration** – Handling missing values, removing whitespaces, and merging multiple datasets

## Data Source

[✓] **Local file** – KIHBS datasets provided by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics

[✓] **Manual cleaning** – Some files manually inspected and cleaned using Excel

## Success Criteria

*The project will be considered successful if it:*

- Clearly shows how income and demographic factors influence household expenditure
- Produces insightful Tableau dashboards 
- Answers the main research question and supports data-driven conclusions
- Identifies potential policy insights or opportunities for vulnerable groups

---



## Stretch Goals 

- Use Machine Learning to predict household vulnerability or classify spending behavior
